Node.js Express and React project.

Work in Progress

This web application helps groups of friends co-ordinate where they want to eat
based on location. A user searches for restaurants in a given area and gets
a list of restaurants at a given url. The user can then send the url to friends
where they can upvote or downvote each restaurant in the list.
